- added support for the gstreamer replaygain plugin. It can scan songs to add replaygain tags. Note that currently the replaygain values can't be seen from within gmusicbrowser (apart from the advanced tag editing dialog). In particular, this means you can't tell which songs have been scanned and which ones haven't. This will be fixed in the future.
- added last "last skip" and "skip count" properties to songs

The popped-up window disappear when the mouse exit the window.

- fixed bug with tabbedlists widget when trying to restore opened tabs if the saved list no longer exist

plugins fixes:

- fixed fetch_cover "more results" button not working with current google pages

improvements:
- changed the plugin system. Now no code in a plugin is loaded until it is activated. Consequences : No memory used by not used plugins. No error messages on startup from not activated plugins. All plugins are listed. errors are displayed in the dialog. All plugins were updated.
- added option to disable/change the way artist names are split
- traytip doesn't popup when in fullscreen mode
- files to play can be specified on the command line, uses existing session if already running, note that playing files not in the library is still experimental
- added the "set as primary filter" option in non-primary filter panes context menu
- added rating submenu in song context menu
- added support for icon themes, includes a gnome-classic and a tango (by Jean-Philippe Guillemin) theme. The tango icons could use some improvements, in particular a random icon distinct from shuffle.

- added an option to only save song properties in the library, not in the file (barely tested)
- added an option to disable automatic check for modification of the current song
- added support for .ape files, it of course requires support by mplayer (very recent, didn't test) or gstreamer (probably not yet supported)
- added support for .wv files, mplayer and gstreamer have plugins for it. Although not all files in the wavepack test suite played properly, I think commonly used files should work.

plugins improvements:
- the picture_finder/fetch_cover plugin now display picture size under the thumbnail
- added multiple sources for the picture_finder/fetch_cover plugin
- added multiple sources for the lyrics plugin
- added an option to the lyrics plugin to auto-save found lyrics, it only auto-save for automatically loaded pages with some sources that have a check to determine if the right lyric is found. Also it won't save pages when the lyrics page is not visible, because they are not loaded. That might not be the expected behavior.
- mozembed plugin : added a test to detect the segmentation fault problem

new layouts widgets:
- added AddLabelEntry widget, to easily add labels to current song
- added widget PlayOrderCombo, the option reqwidth (default to 100, -1 to let it grow, but it can be much to wide) set the requested width, it's best to pack it with the expand option
- added the SongTree widget, it is a replacement for the SongList widget. Some things are still not implemented : drag and dropping columns, playlist, queue or static list mode, moving songs using the EditListButtons widget (arrows button) and type-ahead search. It is very configurable, see the wiki (http://squentin.free.fr/gmusicbrowser/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=customization:songtree) for some documentation.

layouts options:
- labels widget now accept xalign and yalign options, and scrollable labels are now verticaly centered (yalign=.5) by default as they should have been
- added the songypad option to SongList to change the default padding between rows, and the activateX option where X is a number to specify the action when the mouse button X is double-clicked. These options also work for the SongTree widget.
- added layout option "DefaultFocus" to set which widget gets the initial focus, will probably only work with simple widgets, SongList, SongTree and SimpleSearch for now
- added the SetFocusOn command, to set focus on a layout widget, same restrictions as for DefaultFocus
- added the option activate to the SimpleSearch widget, to set a command to run after enter is pressed
- the activate option of the SongList/SongTree can be followed by a command like this : activate=play&CloseWindow
- added the option no_typeahead to SongList and FPane. If true disable automatic searching when a letter/digit is pressed and the SongList/Fpane has focus. The search function can still be called using the "start-interactive-search" gtk key binding (crtl-f on my system).

license :
- changed the licence to the GPL version 3
- the COPYING file now contains the full text of the licence, and cleaned-up/added licence header to most of the perl files.

-the last.fm plugin now use the 1.2 protocol
-improved the fetch cover plugin
-sort orders can now be case-insensitive
-added an option that makes the case-insensitive sort place accented letters right after its unaccented version instead of somewhere after 'z', it is significantly slower than the usual case-insensitive sort (the artist/album/... list always use this sort regardless of this option since there is much less artist/album/genre/... than songs)
-lyrics plugin : ctrl-wheel can be used to change the font size
-auto-scroll for the lyrics plugin, activable in the right-click menu for now
-added a very simple rip plugin to launch a cd-ripping program

-added a new experimental column in the songlist : album picture, the name could be better as it also display album info

included layouts:
-removed some ugly and/or not very interesting layouts ('with comments','with menu','light','with smaller cover','without cover')
-added the layout 'with tabbedlists'

layouts widgets:
-added a ArtistPic widget, same as 'Cover' but for artist, can display multiple artists with the option 'multiple' which can be set to v (vertical) or h (horizontal)
-added a "Fullscreen" widget to switch to/from fullscreen
-added the FR (Frame) container, the shadow type (none, in, out, etched-in, etched-out) can be set with the 'shadow' option
-added a ScrolledWindow container (SB)
-added a Alignment container (AB) syntax : "ABox = (xalign=0,yscale=.5) widget" options are xalign, yalign, xscale, yscale, see http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/GtkAlignment.html

layouts syntax and options:
-the Total widget now accept the size and format option, format can be "long" (default) or "short", size can be among others (http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/pango/PangoMarkupFormat.html) : 'xx-small', 'x-small', 'small', 'medium', 'large', 'x-large', 'xx-large'.
-changed the way the scrolling labels (artist, album and title) are implemented, as a result the empty padding around them is smaller. Added 2 pixels padding in the layouts to compensate.
-buttons widget (Play,Stop,...) and indicators widgets (Filter,Queue,Sort,...) are now handled the same way, the default (button or not) can be changed with button=0 or button=1, relief can be changed for buttons by using the option relief=none(default), half or normal. The size option can be set to menu, small-toolbar, large-toolbar, button, dialog, dnd (the actual size depends on gtk settings)
-added fullscreen/ontop/below properties to layout poperties
-the 'Cover' widget size finally behaves as I wanted from the start, to implement this the H/VBox of the layouts now use a custom size-allocation function. Also added a 'minsize' option, as well as a boolean 'forceratio' option for when used in the tray tip.
-improved parsing of layouts: lines can be broken in multiple lines by ending them with a backslash, matching parenthesis can be included in widget options, parenthesis can be escaped with a backslash, option values can be quoted between " or ' can include "," and a " or ' can be escaped with a backslash. For example these should now work : widget(opt=()) widget(opt=\)) widget(opt="string1,string2") widget(opt="\"string1,string2\"") widget(opt='"string1","string2"')
-Changed syntax of the SM (submenu) container, now all container options are set this way : "HBcontainer = (option1=value1,opt2=value2) ...". All container accept a border option to set border width, SM, EB and FR accept a label option to set the label.
-greatly improved the FB (fixed) container : An optional size request can follow the position ie : x,y,w,h to specify the width/height the widget will request (0 to leave it as by default). x,y,w,h can be relative to the width/height of the container by preceding the number with '.', x,y can be relative to the right/bottom border by prefixing it with '-'.
-layouts can now specify where extra widgets can be added, only the rip plugin use it for now. The syntax is : "ExtraWidgets = widget_type container", widget_type is used to specify what type of widget should go in this container, for example the rip plugin add a widget of type 'button'. Types like 'tab' or 'menuitem' will be used in the future.
-the action when a widget is clicked can be redefined to a custom command by using the option 'click' followed by the button number eg: Play(click2=OpenSongProp) will open song properties dialog when ckicked with the middle mouse button. Buttons also accept the "activate" option.
